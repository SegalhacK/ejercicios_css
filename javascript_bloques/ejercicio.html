            <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a
                variety of reasons.
                It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch
                of different directions.
                JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the
                objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="mini-title">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for
                        storing data values - imagine a cup
                        you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called
                        identifiers. <span class="bold">var x;</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="mini-title">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to
                        JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                        have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                        The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="bold">var x= 10</span>;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="mini-title">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to
                        operate on variables you need to
                        know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean, - <span
                            class="bold">true</span> or
                        <span class="bold">false</span>; null - <span class="bold">null</span> aka nothing; Number -
                        <span class="bold">42</span> or <span class="bold">3.14159</span>; String - <span
                            class="bold">"Coding Dojo Rocks!</span>;" Array -
                        <span class="bold">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span
                            class="bold">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="mini-title">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different
                        actions for different decisions
                        - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use
                        conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                        statements: <span class="bold">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code
                        block; <span class="bold">else</span> if to specify
                        a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="bold">else</span> we
                        execute this block of code;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="mini-title">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every
                        programming language, but essentially do
                        the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,
                        well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="mini-title">Functions Functions</span> are an encapsulation of a code block. When
                        we call our function this will
                        run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting
                        together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the
                        legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished out instructions.
                        Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over again.
                    </p>
